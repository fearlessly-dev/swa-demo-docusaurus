## Step-By-Step Tutorial

### 1. What is Docusaurus?

Docusaurus is an open-source project from Meta that helps you build, deploy, and maintain, open source project websites. It was rated one of the top 3 [rising stars of JavaScript](https://docusaurus.io/) in 2021, under the _static site generators_ category. 

And while it is designed to be optimal for documentation sites (with built-in support for features like content search, localization and versioning), it can actually be used to design and build all kinds of static websites. Just check out their [showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) for some real-world examples.

What makes Docusaurus interesting is that it's **built using React** -- which means developers can write custom React components to extend or enhance the default experience. And it supports content authoring with [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/) - a flavor of JSX-enhanced Markdown that allows you to embed React comoponents _into the content itself_ to support interactions or richer visualizations.

### 2. What can I use it for?

Why not use Docusaurus to create a documentation site for ... **you**. Share your learning journey, or build your portfolio or resume, and keep it updated as you grow your skills! Here are a few ideas to start:

* Start your own **30Days** series (like this one) and share your learnings on a daily basis using the built-in [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) capability. 
* Host materials for reusable workshops using the built-in [hierarchical format](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction) that is perfect for tutorials.
* Create a gallery of projects for a #100devs portfolio using the [Showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) as an example to learn from!

Once you've created and customized the site, you can [deploy it to various hosting providers](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#choosing-a-hosting-provider). Today, let's talk about how you can deploy this to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

## How do I get started?


## Deploying to Azure Static Web Apps


## Exercise: 
The basic scaffold deploys the _classic starter_ provided by Docusaurus. Here are a few things you can try to **customize** your site:
 * Explore [styling and layout](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout) options to theme your site to reflect your brand.
 * Try installing [an officially supported plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins) to unlock richer capabilities like [adding Google Analytics](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-google-analytics).
 * Explore [Progressive Web Apps support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-pwa) to make your website work even when offline.
